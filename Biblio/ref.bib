The magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ measured in 0.1 T shows a cusp for T→0. This behavior is attributed to the proximity to magnetic order: In contrast to CeCu6, CeCu6-xAux alloys show long-range antiferromagnetic order, with TN→0 for xc=0.1. Hence CeCu5.9Au0.1 is at the edge of a zero-temperature quantum phase transition. In a large magnetic field (B3 T) Fermi-liquid behavior is recovered. {\textcopyright} 1994 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Based on the s-d interaction model for dilute magnetic alloys we have calculated the scattering probability of the conduction electrons to the second Born approximation. Because of the dynamical character of the localized spin system, the Pauli principle should be taken into account in the intermediate states of the second order terms. Thus the effect of the Fermi sphere is involved in the scattering probability and gives rise to a singular term in the resistivity which involves c log T as a factor, where c is the concentration of impurity atoms. When combined with the lattice resistivity, this gives rise to a resistance minimum, provided the s-d exchange integral J is negative. The temperature at which the minimum ccurs is proportional to c1/5 and the depth of the minimum to c, as is observed. The predicted log T dependence is tested with available experiments and is confirmed. The value of J to have fit with experiments is about -0.2 ev, which is of reasonable magnitude. Our conclusion is that J should be negative in alloys which show a resistance minimum. It is argued that the resistance minimum is a result of the sharp Fermi surface.},

These effects appear both as an excess temperature-independent scattering and in the form of large anomalies at low temperatures. Interpreted in the light of current theories of localized moments, the resistivity results confirm the existence of virtual bound states near the Fermi level. In addition, the anomalous behavior of the resistivity at low temperatures has been directly related to the existence of a localized magnetic moment. {\textcopyright} 1964 The American Physical Society.},

Especially for rare earth metals, this interaction seems to be the only mechanism which can cause ferro- and antiferromagnetism. However Zener's works are unsatisfactory because his model is phenomenological and moreover does not involve antiferromagnetism and spin wave mode.Our paper considers this s-d interaction on a more rigorous basis. By a certain approximation, there appear long range exchange type interactions between d-electron spins and, in certain conditions both ferro- and antiferromagnetism appear. The excitations of spin wave modes are the same as those in the ordinary modes of the short range exchange force, viz, the energy of the spin wave excitations is proportional to q2 for ferromagnetism and q for antiferromagnetism in the region of small wave vector q. The T3/2 law for the temperature dependence of the magnetization of ferromagnetism is applicable up to very high temperatures, and this result is in good agreement with the results of experiments on metallic ferromagnetism.}",
